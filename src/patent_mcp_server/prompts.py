# Prior Art Search Workflow

A comprehensive prior art search helps identify existing patents and publications
relevant to an invention. Follow this structured approach:

## Step 1: Define the Invention
- Identify the key technical features
- List the problem being solved
- Note any unique aspects or improvements

## Step 2: Keyword Search (Broad)
Start with broad text searches to understand the landscape:

```
Use patentsview_search_patents or ppubs_search_patents:
- Search key terms from the invention description
- Try synonyms and alternative phrasings
- Use search_type="any" for broad results first
```

## Step 3: Identify Relevant CPC Codes
From initial results, identify CPC classification codes:

```
Use patentsview_lookup_cpc to understand classifications:
- Note CPC codes from relevant patents found
- Look up parent/child codes for broader/narrower scope
```

## Step 4: CPC-Based Search (Focused)
Search within relevant CPC classifications:

```
Use patentsview_search_by_cpc:
- Focus on identified CPC codes
- Combine with keywords if needed
```

## Step 5: Inventor/Assignee Search
Find patents from key players in the field:

```
Use patentsview_search_inventors and patentsview_search_assignees:
- Search for prolific inventors in the field
- Find competitors' patent portfolios
```

## Step 6: Citation Analysis
Review what prior art examiners have cited:

```
Use get_office_action_citations:
- Check citations from related applications
- Follow citation chains backward and forward
```

## Step 7: International Coverage
Expand to international patents:

```
Use ppubs_search_patents for PCT applications published in US:
- Search for WO (PCT) applications
- Note: USPTO tools focus on US patents and applications
```

## Tips:
- Document all searches performed for completeness
- Save relevant patent numbers for detailed review
- Check patent family relationships with get_app_continuity
- Review full claims using patentsview_get_claims

FREEDOM_TO_OPERATE_PROMPT = """
# Freedom to Operate (FTO) Analysis Workflow

Assess the risk of patent infringement for a product or technology.

## Step 1: Define the Product/Technology
- List all technical features and components
- Identify the country/countries of operation
- Note planned manufacturing, sale, and use locations

## Step 2: Keyword and Classification Search
```
Use patentsview_search and patentsview_search_by_cpc:
- Search for each technical feature
- Use multiple synonyms and phrasings
- Focus on relevant CPC classifications
```

## Step 3: Identify Potentially Relevant Patents
For each patent found, evaluate:
- Is it still in force? (check expiration)
- Does it cover the geography of interest?
- Are the claims potentially reading on your product?

## Step 4: Detailed Claim Analysis
```
Use patentsview_get_claims and ppubs_get_patent_by_number:
- Read independent claims carefully
- Compare each claim element to your product
- Document any differences (design-arounds)
```

PRODUCT_PATENT_SEARCH_PROMPT = """
# Product Patent Search Workflow (Optimized)

Based on successful search experiences from real cases, this workflow implements
proven strategies for finding product-related patents.

## Search Strategy Patterns

| Product Type | Search Strategy | Example Query |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| Design product | Exact phrase in title | "product name" |
| Functional device | Scene + device keywords | "scene device" |
| Complex product | Inventor tracking | Find inventor from similar patent |

## Step 1: Product Analysis

**CRITICAL: Ask the user about HIDDEN FEATURES before searching!**

E-commerce listings describe "selling points" but miss "patent points":
- Listing says: "self watering pot with indicator"
- Real patent may describe: "pot with rotatable bottom"

Ask the user:
1. "Does the product have structural features NOT mentioned in the listing?"
2. "Check these areas: bottom structure, rotating parts, detachable mechanisms"
3. "If you have product photos, check the bottom/side/back view"

## Step 2: Construct Keywords

Build keywords from:
1. **Product category**: pot, ashtray, smoker, container
2. **Core features**: self watering, detachable, rotatable
3. **Hidden features** (from user input): mechanisms not visible in listing

Remove: dimensions, colors, quantities, marketing words, brand names

## Step 3: Multi-Strategy Search

Use `ppubs_search_combined` for comprehensive coverage:
```
ppubs_search_combined("keywords from product")
```

This runs 4 strategies automatically:
- Exact phrase search
- Title search
- Last 2-3 words search
- AND combination search

## Step 4: Inventor Tracking (Important!)

When you find a relevant patent, check the inventor's other patents:
```
ppubs_get_inventor_patents("patent_number")
```

This discovers hidden related patents by the same inventor.
Often reveals patents with different names but similar structures.

## Step 5: Assignee Tracking

Track company patent families:
```
ppubs_search_by_assignee("company name")
```

Finds continuation applications and related patents from the same company.

## Step 6: Precise Title Search

For design patents, use title search:
```
ppubs_search_by_ttl("product keywords")
```

Most effective for products with clear, specific names.

## Step 7: Result Analysis

For each patent found:
1. Check if design patent (D-series) - often most relevant for products
2. Compare title keywords match
3. Note inventors for further tracking
4. Check assignee for family relationships
5. Verify the patent matches the product structure (not just name)

## Key Success Factors

| Factor | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| Keep original phrasing | Don't remove "stop words" like "with", "and" |
| Inventor tracking | Always check inventor's other patents |
| Multiple strategies | Use combined search, not single query |
| Ask about hidden features | User input reveals unlisted structures |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Filter stop words | USPTO needs exact phrase | Keep original phrasing |
| Single search | Misses related patents | Use combined + inventor tracking |
| Only listing keywords | Misses hidden features | Ask user about structure |
| Ignore inventor info | Misses related patents | Track inventor's portfolio |

# Patent Landscape Analysis Workflow

Map the patent landscape for a technology area to understand the competitive environment.

## Step 1: Define Technology Scope
- Identify the core technology area
- List related/adjacent technologies
- Define time period of interest

## Step 2: Identify Key CPC Classifications
```
Use patentsview_lookup_cpc:
- Find relevant CPC codes
- Map hierarchical relationships
- Note any cross-cutting codes
```

## Step 3: Quantitative Analysis
```
Use patentsview_search_by_cpc with large limits:
- Count total patents per CPC code
- Track filings over time
- Identify growth trends
```

## Step 4: Top Assignee Analysis
```
Use patentsview_search_assignees:
- Rank companies by patent count
- Calculate market share of filings
- Identify new entrants vs incumbents
```

## Step 5: Geographic Distribution
```
Use patentsview_search_patents with assignee filters:
- Compare filing volumes by assignee location
- Identify regional leaders among US filers
- Note PCT (WO) filing trends via ppubs_search_applications
```

## Step 6: Technology Clustering
Group patents into sub-categories:
- By specific CPC subclasses
- By claim feature keywords
- By application type (method, system, composition)

## Step 7: Citation Network Analysis
```
Use get_enriched_citations:
- Identify highly-cited foundational patents
- Map citation relationships
- Find technology leaders by citation metrics
```

## Step 8: White Space Analysis
Identify underserved areas:
- CPC codes with low filing activity
- Technology combinations not covered
- Emerging areas with few patents

## Deliverables:
- Filing trend charts
- Top assignee rankings
- Technology taxonomy/map
- Geographic distribution
- Key/seminal patents
