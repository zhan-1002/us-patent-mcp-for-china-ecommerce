## PatentsView

PatentsView uses JSON query syntax:

### Operators:
- `_eq` - Equals
- `_neq` - Not equals
- `_gt`, `_gte` - Greater than (or equal)
- `_lt`, `_lte` - Less than (or equal)
- `_begins` - Starts with
- `_contains` - Contains
- `_text_any` - Full-text match any word
- `_text_all` - Full-text match all words
- `_text_phrase` - Full-text exact phrase

### Example Queries:
```json
{"patent_title": {"_contains": "neural network"}}
{"_and": [
    {"patent_date": {"_gte": "2020-01-01"}},
    {"assignee_organization": {"_contains": "IBM"}}
]}
{"_or": [
    {"_text_any": {"patent_title": "machine learning"}},
    {"_text_any": {"patent_abstract": "machine learning"}}
]}
```

## ODP (Open Data Portal)

### Application Search:
- `q` - General query string
- `applicationNumberText` - Application number
- `patentNumber` - Patent number
- `inventorName` - Inventor name
- `assigneeName` - Assignee name
- `appFilingDate` - Filing date range

### Example:
`q=machine learning&appFilingDate=2020-01-01,2023-12-31`

## Common Tips:

1. **Use quotes for phrases**: "neural network" vs neural network
2. **Combine with AND/OR**: term1 AND term2, term1 OR term2
3. **Use wildcards carefully**: wildcard* searches can be slow
4. **Filter by date**: Narrow results with date ranges
5. **Use CPC codes**: Most precise for technology areas
